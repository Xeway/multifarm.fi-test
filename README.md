First, thank you for contacting me and offering me this opportunity. It means a lot for me 🙏🏻

To be honest, the most difficult part of this test was to find how the APR is calculated in the Github repository you gave me. Indeed, the js file you gave me wasn't the only computation. At the end, a function is called and here the real challenge begin. I had to read hundreds of lines of code, because inside a function, another function is called, and another one, etc... It's very very long, and very "abstract" and theoretical since I can't really do tests and therefore see what variables are (+ no comments in the code).

Here are the modules used: `Web3`, `HTTPProvider`, `json`, `requests`.
And I haven't used Metamask 😄

To run the script, run the main.py file.

Hope this test will satisfy you,
